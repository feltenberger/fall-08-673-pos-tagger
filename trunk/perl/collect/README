 To merge
================================================================================
    
run:
    ./merge.sh
    
There is a ROOT_DIR variable inside the script. 
Check to be sure that your corpus dir-tree is the same. [PATH]
    

================================================================================
 To collect data
================================================================================

run:
    ./collect.pl < merged.list

It will create for files. Please look inside collect.pl and modify it as you need.
This script should be a good staring place. I tried to comment everything so that 
it's easy to understand what I've coded there. Perl is somewhat cryptic :), That's
why I tried to write it in a non-cryptic manner.
