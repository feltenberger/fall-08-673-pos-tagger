TO GENERATE 2-GRAM PROBABILITIES
--------------------------------

Copy all training files to ./IN directory
    
   For example:
       
      To generate probabilites for 80/20 and 50/50 training corpus 2-grams:
        
         * Place all 80training<n>.pos files inside 'IN' directory
	 * Open ./generate-prob.sh and modify the SETS variable to 
	   include whichever sets you want to generate.
         * To generate 80/20 and 50/50 set SETS to "50 80"
	 * run ./generate-probs.sh  
	 
      The generated files will reside in "OUT" directory.
